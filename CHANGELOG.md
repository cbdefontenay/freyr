# Changelog

## [.1.3] - 08.10.2024
### Added
- Adding a customizable `DropdownMenu` component. Users can now define their own hover background color, labels color, menu color etc, from the `DropdownConfig`.

### Fixed
- Fixed the `config` naming for the components for more readability. Example: `config_navbar`.
- Fixed an issue where dropdown links were not styled properly on hover.
